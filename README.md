# Corymbia citriodora

Lemon Scented Gum

A beautiful, tall growing tree with a distinctive, often powdery white to grey coloured bark which curls and flakes off in spring. Its leaves are green, long and slender with an amazing, strong lemon fragrance when crushed. Its strong scent is a distinguishing attribute, with the essential oils produced from this variety often being used in fragrances as well as insect repellents. In summer and autumn, feathery white flowers appear, making it a good source of food for honey bees.
